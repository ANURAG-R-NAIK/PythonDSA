#Given an array A of n positive numbers. The task is to find the first index 
#in the array such that the sum of elements before it is equal to the sum of elements after it.

# x = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
# N = len(x)

# def equalSum(self,A, N):
#         for i in range(N):
#                 if sum(A[0:i]) == sum(A[i+1:N]):
#                 return i+1
        
#         return -1
